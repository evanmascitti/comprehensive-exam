The 13 differences between coarse-grained and fine-grained soils:

1. Fine grained: behavior highly dependent on water content 
1. fine-grained: can be plastic
1. fine grained behavior determined by surface force + contact force rather than contact force and gravitational forces
1. fine-grained: platy shape vs bulky shape 
1. fine-grained: contains clay minerals
1. fine-grained: not dimensionally stable 
1. coarse-grained: resistant to mechanical breakdown; fine-grained: resistant to chemical weathering 
1. fine-grained: small voids
1. fine-grained: high specific surface area
1. fine-grained: high surface charge 
1. fine-grained: low conductivity
1. fine-grained: high capillary pressure when unsaturated 
1. fine-grained: un-drained loading dominates 
1. fine-grained: easier to obtain "intact" core specimen
1. fine-grained: properties determined by composition in addition to size and shape
